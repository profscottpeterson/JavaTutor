    The Java programming language was originally developed by James Gosling
    at Sun Microsystems (since acquired by Oracle) and first released in 1991.  It was developed to be
    an object oriented programming language and is intended to simplify the development process for
    programmers by providing a "write once, run anywhere" concept, meaning that compiled Java code will
    run on any platform that Java supports without having to recompile.  This saves a great amount of time
    for developers and simplifies the development process, because developers don't need to worry about
    learning the specific details of each platform.\n\n

    Java is one of the most, if not the most, popular programming languages in use today, with over nine
    million developers.  </string>
